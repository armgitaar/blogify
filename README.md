---

Alpas is a batteries-included yet a modular web framework for Kotlin with a very strong focus on developers' productivity.

The main goal of Alpas is to get you started quickly and enable you to move faster while letting you enjoy doing what you are the best at â€” crafting a delightful web app.

It is fun to build an HTML web app or an API only app with Alpas.

Alpas strives to be simple and elegant and wants to serve you whether you have written any JVM based web
apps before or notâ€”there is no xml or properties files to configure, no scattered annotations
to memorizeâ€”and yet, there is no huge learning curve to get started.

Alpas comes bundled with most of what you need to write modern web appsâ€”**authentication**,
**auth scaffolding**, **email verification**, **notifications**, **mail**, **queues**,
**fast and intuitive routing**, **powerful templating engine** etc.â€”and yet it
remains flexible for you to extend it to make it more powerful and
delightful than it already is.

We have sweated picking the good parts, so you donâ€™t have to!

Alpas is also very modular so you still have the authority to choose what you like and don't like.
Create an HTML web app or keep it simple with an API only app, Alpas gets out of the way to let you take the control.
