Blogify is an example of how you can make a blog using the [Alpas framework](https://alpas.dev). 

I didn't use authentication in this project - though, that's just a couple more lines of code to add authentication for add/edit/delete actions which I'll work on shortly. 

Feel free to use as a base for your own blog project or as an exercise to become more familiar with some of the functionality in the Alpas Web Framework. 

Check out [Alpas Resources](https://github.com/alpas/resources) for additional resources and example apps for the Alpas web framework.
